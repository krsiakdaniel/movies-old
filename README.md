## 📦 Deployment

App uses [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/movies-krsiak/deploys) to build from `master` branch and deploys on each commit.

## 🔨 Scripts

Have a look in [Makefile](Makefile) for available scripts.

### React

```

```

Build the app in `/build/` folder.

```
make build
```

### Prettier

Changed files are formatted on save in editor and with each commit using [.prettierrc](.prettierrc) options. It can be done manually as well.

```
make prettier
```
